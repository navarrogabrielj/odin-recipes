            <p>Adobo is a popular Filipino dish characterized by meat, usually chicken or pork,
            marinated and simmered in a savory sauce made from soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, and black pepper.
            The cooking process tenderizes the meat and infuses it with a rich, tangy, and slightly sweet flavor. 
            Adobo is often served with steamed rice and is known for its deliciously balanced taste and versatility.</p>
