        <ol>
            <li>Bring the water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken. Boil the chicken in low to medium heat for 45 minutes or until tender.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken and let cool. Set-aside the water used to boil the chicken. We'll use this later.</li>
            <li>Once the chicken reaches room temperature, shred the meat using your hands. Discard (throw away) the bones.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat a clean large cooking pot.</li>
            <li>Pour-in the butter and oil. Once the butter and oil becomes hot, sauté the onion, carrot, and celery for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the shredded chicken and chopped ham. Cook for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour-in the chicken broth and the remaining water used to boil the chicken. Stir and let boil. Simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the elbow macaroni. Cook for 15 minutes. Add more water if needed.</li>
            <li>Pour-in the milk. Stir and let boil.</li>
